Problem Statement Regarding Company


The Dream Housing Finance Company handles all types of mortgages. All urban, semi-urban, and rural areas are served by them. After the company confirms the customer's eligibility for a loan, the customer applies for a house loan.

Problem


The business wants to automate (in real-time) the loan eligibility process using the information customers supply on the online application form. These information include the following: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and Other. They've created a challenge to help them identify the client categories that are eligible for loan amounts in order to automate this procedure and target these customers in particular. They've only given us a portion of the data set here.
